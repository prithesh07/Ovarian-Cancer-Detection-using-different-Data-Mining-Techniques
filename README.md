Early detection of ovarian cancer has been potential to dramatically reduce mortality. Recently, the use of
advanced data mining algorithms has been reported as a promising method to achieve this goal. Many
researchers have been applying various algorithms and techniques like Classification, Clustering, Regression,
Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks, Association Rules, Decision Trees, Genetic Algorithm, Nearest
Neighbour method etc., to help health care professionals with improved accuracy in the diagnosis of ovarian
cancer. In our study we have used the TCGA ovarian cancer database
